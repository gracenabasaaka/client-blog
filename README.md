The client blog is one of the html projects we worked on during the first weeks of the my codetalk bootcamp at St. Joseph Center. 
We were grouped into pairs, each of had to build a website for the other using html. One of was the web developer while the other one had to act as the client. The client provided content such as color, images and what they wanted the site to be about.
